- Repository: `fintechbankx-platform-observability-sre`
- Source monorepo: `enterprise-loan-management-system`
- Sync date: `2026-03-15`
- Sync branch: `chore/granular-source-sync-20260313`

## Applied Rules

- dir: `k8s/observability` -> `k8s/observability`
- dir: `scripts/monitoring` -> `scripts/monitoring`
- dir: `scripts/prometheus` -> `scripts/prometheus`
- dir: `scripts/grafana` -> `scripts/grafana`
- dir: `docs/monitoring` -> `docs/monitoring`
- dir: `docs/observability` -> `docs/observability`

## Notes

- This is an extraction seed for bounded-context split migration.
- Follow-up refactoring may be needed to remove residual cross-context coupling.
- Build artifacts and local machine files are excluded by policy.
